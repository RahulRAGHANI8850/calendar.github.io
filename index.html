            A calendar is an important tool for keeping track of the days, weeks, and months of the year. It is a system
            of organizing days for social, religious, commercial, or administrative purposes. The calendar is used to
            structure time and can be based on a variety of different cycles or periods. Most calendars include a system
            of divisions, such as days, weeks, months, and years, and many also include holidays and other significant
            dates. Calendars are also used to track and plan events such as meetings, appointments, and vacations. In
            addition, some calendars are used for religious or cultural purposes, such as marking the start of Ramadan
            or celebrating the Chinese New Year.</dd>
